Today I was on the road most of the time.
I went on a spontaneous trip to Cracow.
I was driving most of the time but then I wasn't, I followed along [this tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views) and I found out about a lot of very useful UI components.
I am going to use them in my side project as soon as possible.
That's all for today.
