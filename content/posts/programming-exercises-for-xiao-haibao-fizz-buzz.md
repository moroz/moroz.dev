Write a program that accepts one command-line argument _n_ (2 &gt;= n &lt;= 100,000) and prints to standard
output all natural numbers from 1 to _n_,
but for numbers that are multiplies of 3, it should print "Fizz" instead of the number
and for the multiplies of 5 it should print "Buzz" instead of the number.
For numbers that are multiplies of both 3 and 5 it should print "FizzBuzz" instead of
the number.

Example usage:

```bash
moroz:~/teaching/fizz_buzz$ ts-node ./fizzBuzz.ts 25
