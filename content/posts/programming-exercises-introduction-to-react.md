1. Get acquainted with React as a framework, its basic syntax and usage.

2. Create a React app (using `create-react-app`) and implement a view which displays a form with a text input and a submit button. This will be your first TODO app. When the user submits the form, the content of the input field (the "todo item") should be added to the beginning of the TODO list.

You can use TypeScript or ES6, and build your React components using either the older class syntax or using functional components with hooks.

Deadline: October 25, 2020, 6 PM UTC+8.
