  I made my first steps building a watchOS application according to Apple's SwiftUI tutorial.

---

Following Apple's tutorial on SwiftUI development, I finished the carousel view on the main screen of the application by adding dots for controlling each view, and built a very simple watchOS application.
Building watchOS applications using SwiftUI turns out to be very simple and it seems that a lot of the code can be reused.

Just as I suspected, there exists a built-in API for synchronizing data between Apple Watch and the iOS app.
The API is called Watch Connectivity, which is abbreviated as <abbr title="Watch Connectivity">WC</abbr>.

I want to try it out on my side project, so I won't be writing anything else today.
